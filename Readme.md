This tutorial showcases packaging a precompiled binary in the `resources/` directory of an app(let).

## Precompiling a Binary
In this applet, the SAMtools binary was precompiled on an Ubuntu 14.04 machine. A user can do this compilation on an Ubuntu 14.04 machine of their own, or they can utilize the Cloud Workstation app to build and compile a binary. On the Cloud Workstation, the user can download the SAMtools source code and compile it in the worker environment, ensuring that the binary will run on future workers.

See [Cloud Workstation](https://wiki.dnanexus.com/Developer-Tutorials/Cloud-Workstations) in the App library for more information.

## Resources Directory
The SAMtools precompiled binary is placed in the `<applet dir>/resources/` directory. Any files found in the `resources/` directory will be packaged, uploaded to the platform, and then unpackaged in the root directory `\` of the worker. In our case, the `resources/` dir is structured as follows:
```
├── Applet dir
│   ├── src
│   ├── dxapp.json
│   ├── resources
│       ├── usr
│           ├── bin
│               ├── < samtools binary >
```
When this applet is run on a worker, the `resources/` directory will be placed in the worker's root directory `/`:
```
/
├── usr
│   ├── bin
│       ├── < samtools binary >
├── home
│   ├── dnanexus
│   	├── applet script
```
We are able to access the SAMtools command because the respective binary is visible from the default `$PATH` variable. The directory `/usr/bin/` is part of the `$PATH` variable, so in our script we can reference the samtools command directly:
<!--SECTION: Run samtools view -->
